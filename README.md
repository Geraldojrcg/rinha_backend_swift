Vapor is an HTTP web framework for Swift. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy-to-use foundation for your next website, API, or cloud project.

## Build & Run

### Xcode

First, open the project in Xcode:

`open Package.swift`

It will automatically begin downloading Swift Package Manager dependencies. This can take some time the first time you open a project. When dependency resolution is complete Xcode will populate the available schemes.

At the top of the window, to the right of the Play and Stop buttons, click on your project name to select the project's Scheme, and select an appropriate run targetâ€”most likely, "My Mac". Click the play button to build and run your project.

You should see the Console pop up at the bottom of the Xcode window.
